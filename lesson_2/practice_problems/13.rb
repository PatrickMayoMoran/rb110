# PROBLEM: Given the following data structure, return a new array containing the same
# sub arrays sorted by number, but only
# taking into consideration the odd numbers they contain

arr = [[1, 6, 9], [6, 1, 7], [1, 8, 3], [1, 5, 9]]

# example output
[[1, 8, 3], [1, 5, 9], [6, 1, 7], [1, 6, 9]]

# ALGORITHM
# return a new array (returned by sort)
# start sort loop to compare elements
# transform elements so that they only have odd numbers
#   loop through sub arrays
#   for each sub array, loop through and select only odd numbers
#

def odd_sort(array)
end
